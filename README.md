# Give Angular a chance

Work at Olist Frontend, let be me =), let be Angular too =).

# WHY ANGULAR?

Actualy is one of the most powerfull mechanism to work beacause has a great community, is oriented by component and one of the Angular premissis is the component reuse to prevent rework, Angular made easy the relationship and the contex share beetween components, Angular use Typescript that can made your application code be typed and this is great, because help the developer life, right? Besides that, Typescript is a language that use ECMA like javascript, however, typescript is nearer of the last ECMA version.  Give a try.

# Mind Trap

For the concepts descripbed in the specification I prevented my mind to make things more than the specification =). I thinked in a poc application with login and a home after the login using something like JWT for the authentication, Angular routes and another little things that isn't specified for this test, then mind free, mind free.

* Use [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)), [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

## Git rebase

I prefer to use rebase to make only one commit per feature because, the git tree will be small in relation to various small commits. Besides that, if the feature really need to more than one commit it's ok. For example, I made a commit and a push fotr the sign up component, but now I need to update de readme.md then I will make two commit and two push
